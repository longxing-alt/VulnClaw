## What It Does

Give it a natural language command and watch it run a full pentest:

```
User:   "Run a penetration test on http://target.example.com"

VulnClaw executes:
  Round 1:  Recon → Fingerprinting, port scan, directory enumeration
  Round 2:  Vulnerability Discovery → Injection points, known CVEs, misconfigs
  Round 3:  Exploitation → PoC verification, access obtained
  Round 4:  Reporting → Structured report + Python PoC script
```

Suitable for authorized pentests, CTF competitions, security training, and red team operations.

## Features

- **Model-Led Solver Engine (default)** — Claude Code/Codex-style autonomous loop: the model decides the next action, tool usage, completion, user questions, or no-path termination
- **Parallel Sub-Agent Fan-Out** — The model can spawn multiple independent sub-agents in a single turn via `spawn_subagents`; each sub-agent inherits target constraints and evidence, runs concurrently with its own lifecycle budget; sub-evidence is merged back into the parent state with unified `eNNN` renumbering
- **Cold/Hot Memory Separation** — Hot conversation context retains only recent complete tool-exchange groups (default 48 messages / 32K tokens); older messages are archived to rotating JSONL shards; `memory_search` retrieves relevant archived turns on demand
- **Unified Context Budget & Structured Compaction** — All LLM call paths go through `prepare_context()`, which estimates tokens (including tool schemas), triggers structured compaction at 70% of usable context, and generates a deterministic `[context digest v1]` summary (target/scope/verified facts/evidence references) — no LLM free-form summarization needed
- **TUI Sub-Agent Monitor** — Real-time panel showing each sub-agent's role, status, step count, and latest progress via a private JSON-line protocol
- **AgentState Evidence Memory** — Tool results are stored in `AgentState.evidence` with complete raw text preserved; active context receives bounded high-signal previews by default, while `evidence_search` / `evidence_view` revisit raw evidence on demand
- **Lightweight Correction Layer** — Records repeated calls, degraded tools, timing, and new observations; repeated reads of the same evidence range are suppressed and evidence-only stalls trigger a stall guard without restoring the old stage planner
- **Evidence-Level Anti-Hallucination Gate** — Claims about flags/conclusions must appear verbatim in real tool output to be accepted; prevents fabricated flags
- **Natural Language Driven** — Describe your goal in plain English, auto-identifies phases and tools
- **14 LLM Providers** — OpenAI / Anthropic / MiniMax / DeepSeek / Zhipu / Moonshot / Qwen / SiliconFlow / Doubao / Baichuan / StepFun / SenseTime / Yi / local Ollama, one-command switch
- **MCP Toolchain** — 4 MCP services: `fetch` / `memory` run locally out-of-the-box, `chrome-devtools` / `burp` connect to external MCP servers for browser automation and HTTP interception
- **Enhanced fetch request tool** — Defaults to GET, returns the full response body, and supports HTTP/HTTPS, custom method/headers/params/cookies/body/data/form/json, timeout/redirect/TLS controls; TLS verification is off by default for CTF/lab HTTPS targets
- **Native Traffic Evidence Store** — In-scope request/response pairs land in an append-only JSONL index under `evidence/traffic/`. Built-in `traffic_list` / `traffic_view` / `traffic_repeat` / `traffic_sitemap` tools read and replay the store
- **AI Agent Core** — OpenAI-compatible protocol + Tool Calling + autonomous pentest loop
- **Structured Reasoning + Adaptive Reflection** — Facts/constraints/attack chains structured and injected into prompts; failures auto-classified with L0-L4 payload escalation
- **Vulnerability Detection Plugin System** — Low-coupling plugin runtime + built-in read-only Web plugins, results auto-merged into reports (`vulnclaw plugins`)
- **50 Specialized Skills** — CTF, Web, intranet, reversing, vulnerability validation, and authorized red-team knowledge; skills are exposed as optional reference indexes only, and full reference bodies are loaded only when the model explicitly calls `load_skill_reference`
- **Encode/Decode & Crypto Tools** — 29 operations (Base64/Hex/URL/AES/JWT/Morse etc.), LLM calls them directly, no guessing
- **Automatic Source Rendering** — `fetch` / `http_probe_batch` automatically prepend clean source before raw bodies when they see `highlight_file`, highlighted HTML source, or noisy HTML/JS bodies; `http_probe_batch` verifies TLS by default (opt-out per request when probing self-signed lab targets) and records full response headers so runtime clues such as `X-Powered-By` are not lost; built-in `source_extract` remains available for revisiting saved evidence and pinning dangerous sinks, forms, inputs, and endpoints
- **Local Command Verification** — Built-in `shell_command` supports Codex-style local checks such as `php -r` serialization tests, exact `curl` requests, and `rg`/`Select-String` file searches; raw stdout/stderr are preserved in evidence, and large active-context observations use high-signal previews
- **Runtime Differential Probing** — Built-in `runtime_diff_probe` helps the model build compact local tables for regex/string-filter vs runtime-parser mismatches, including PHP serialize/unserialize lexical variants, target/local runtime version mismatch notes, and PHP5 signed-length candidates that must be verified remotely instead of being discarded due to newer local PHP behavior
- **Python Code Execution** — Built-in `python_execute` tool for payload crafting and response parsing; currently still a high-risk experimental capability, not a strong isolation sandbox, and **disabled by default** (enable explicitly via `safety.enable_python_execute` in config)
- **Batch HTTP Probing** — Built-in `http_probe_batch` compares URL/parameter/header/body/raw-URL variants in one call, preserves each raw response body in evidence, and shows the audited request surface plus high-signal response preview in model-visible output to reduce repeated LLM/tool rounds
- **Near-Miss Stop Guard** — solve keeps the evidence gate and adds a generic `NO_PATH` guard: when unresolved high-signal anchors such as source sinks, forms/parameters, request surfaces, local proof or response differentials exist, a single no-output/same-body payload attempt is not accepted as proof that the path is dead
- **Persistent Pentesting** — Cyclic runs (100 rounds/cycle × 10 cycles = 1000 rounds), auto-reports every cycle
- **Thinking Process Control** — `think on/off` toggles LLM reasoning visibility
- **Sandbox Mode Prompting** — Unlocks AI security testing capabilities, for CTF and authorized pentest scenarios
- **Auto Report & PoC** — Generates structured Markdown reports and runnable Python PoC scripts
- **Web UI Mode** — `vulnclaw web` launches a local web interface, default `127.0.0.1:7788`
- **Security Knowledge Base** — Includes KB module and baseline seed data; retrieval augmentation being integrated
- **CONTRIBUTING_EN.md** — English contributing guide for international contributors

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI (recommended)
pip install vulnclaw

# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/Netw0rkNoob/VulnClaw.git
cd VulnClaw
pip install -e .
```

### Run with Docker (optional)

The image bundles the Web UI plus runtimes (`npx` / `uvx`) for default MCP servers. All state persists in a `/data` volume.

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # add VULNCLAW_LLM_API_KEY etc.
docker compose up --build      # build the image and start the Web UI
# open http://127.0.0.1:7788
```

Or run a one-off CLI command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e VULNCLAW_LLM_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here \
  -v vulnclaw-data:/data \
  vulnclaw:latest scan <target>
```

> ⚠️ `localhost` inside the container refers to the container itself. To scan a host service use `host.docker.internal`. See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md).

### Four-Step Launch

```bash
# 1. Select provider (auto-fills Base URL and model name)
vulnclaw config provider minimax   # or openai / anthropic / deepseek / zhipu / moonshot / qwen / siliconflow / ollama

# 1.2 (optional) custom Base URL or model name
vulnclaw config set llm.base_url https://your-own-api.example.com/v1
vulnclaw config set llm.model your-model-name

# 2. Set API Key
vulnclaw config set llm.api_key sk-your-key-here
#    — or sign in with ChatGPT subscription (no API key needed):
#      vulnclaw login   (browser sign-in; see docs/keyless-auth.md, note ToS caveat)

# 3. Default: open the original CLI / REPL
vulnclaw

# 4. Optional: open the TUI workbench
vulnclaw tui
```

## Architecture

### Solver Engine

VulnClaw defaults to the **model-led solve engine** (switch back to fixed-round with `vulnclaw config set session.engine rounds`).

**Model-Led Loop:** The framework no longer decomposes a task into forced "research directions", and it no longer schedules directory scans, JS reconnaissance, or SQLi checks by phase templates. solve provides the target, conversation context, evidence memory, and tool catalog; the model decides the next action.

| Primitive | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Model context** | Target, user constraints, recent messages, evidence summaries, and executed tool calls |
| **Tool catalog** | `fetch`, browser, directory enumeration, JS recon, encode/decode, Python, `shell_command`, `source_extract`, `runtime_diff_probe`, skill lookup, and other capabilities exposed only as optional hands |
| **Tool transcript** | After tool execution, assistant `tool_calls` and `role=tool` observations are appended to model history; large outputs use high-signal previews so HTML bodies, logs, and response blobs do not repeatedly pollute active context |
| **AgentState evidence** | Every real tool result is stored in `AgentState.evidence`; raw text is preserved with evidence id/hash/size, and the model can use `evidence_search` / `evidence_view` to revisit exact content |
| **High-signal memory** | Source SQL, HTML forms/inputs, linked PHP/API files, JavaScript endpoints, `highlight_file` source, and `unserialize`/magic-method/dangerous-sink snippets are pinned as durable facts so later probes do not bury the actual entry point |
| **Lightweight correction layer** | Observes tool lifecycle only: timing, degraded failures, repeated calls, high-signal target facts, and small semantic deltas become next-turn hints; it does not plan stages or schedule tools |
| **Evidence gate** | `FINAL:` conclusions must cite or match real evidence; unsupported flags/conclusions are rejected and the model continues |
| **Automatic solve report** | After completion, solve generates a Markdown replay report with reasoning chain, key evidence, raw replay request, curl command, response excerpt, and evidence index |

```
MODEL DECIDES → optional tool call → AgentState records full raw evidence + active-context high-signal preview + correction hints
        │
continue reasoning / continue tool use / ASK_USER / NO_PATH / FINAL
        │
FINAL passes evidence gate → accepted; otherwise the rejection is fed back and solve continues
```

**Context Strategy:** solve keeps ordinary conversation history by default. Hot context is bounded to 48 messages / 32K tokens; when exceeded, older messages are archived to cold-memory JSONL shards and retrievable via `memory_search`. The unified context budget (`prepare_context()`) estimates tokens (including tool schemas) across all LLM call paths and triggers structured compaction at 70% of usable context, generating a deterministic `[context digest v1]` summary with target/scope/verified facts/evidence references. Tool output is fully stored in `AgentState.evidence`, while large outputs enter active context as bounded high-signal previews. The same raw output appearing again gets a `same_as=eXXX` reference instead of repeating the body.

**Evidence-Level Anti-Hallucination Gate:** Records all real tool output as the sole trusted evidence. Claims about flags/conclusions must appear in real output or cite evidence ids before they are accepted. `NO_PATH` is also gated by the near-miss guard: if unresolved high-signal anchors remain in evidence, the rejection reason is fed back to the model for another concrete verification step instead of stopping immediately.

**Automatic Solve Report:** When solve reaches the goal, VulnClaw deterministically renders a Markdown replay report from `AgentState` and prints it by default. It does not make another LLM call; replay packets, curl commands and response excerpts come from real `fetch` / `http_probe_batch` evidence.

**Authorized Red-Team Skills:** Authorized red-team detail packs from `codex-redteam-mode` are imported as skills/knowledge for on-demand use; jailbreak, refusal-bypass, and session-patching content is not imported.

Skills are resolved from user input into an optional reference index. VulnClaw does not automatically inject skill bodies, phase workflows, or methodology scripts into the system prompt. Specialized skills include detailed methodology documents in `references/`, and the model loads them only when it chooses to call `load_skill_reference`.

## Language

VulnClaw ships with a built-in **English / 中文 (Chinese)** bilingual interface. The default is **English** (`auto` mode falls back to English), so international users never hit a language wall; Chinese is fully preserved and both modes produce identical behavior.

Switch the UI language any of three ways:

| Method | Example |
|---|---|
| REPL command | `/language en` or `/language zh` (or `/language auto`) inside the interactive REPL |
| Environment variable | `VULNCLAW_LANG=zh` / `VULNCLAW_LANG=en` |
| Config file | `session.language: auto \| zh \| en` in `~/.vulnclaw/config.yaml` |

Everything user-visible in the CLI follows the current language: REPL messages and status banners, event stream, solve reports, knowledge-base status, and LLM retry/recovery notices. Agent detection keyword tables are bilingual, so English or Chinese task phrasing is classified the same way. (Note: the web dashboard is not yet localized; that's planned separately.)
